      <description>I wrote this on the 12th of November 2015 On this day in 1984 my parents brought home my baby sister. Roughly this day, todayâ€™s her birthday but I think despite my dramatic beginning to this story she actually came home a few days after November 12th, because there were some slight complications and she spent a few days in a humidity crib. One way or the other today is her birthday.</description>

      <description>This site is authored in markdown and compliled to static pages with Hugo. The theme is a Split Template by One Page Love
I use Visual Sudio Code and Github Desktop to author this on my 2019 Macbook Pro (I still have an eGPU so I&amp;rsquo;m still on Intel.) I use a mix of Firefox, Safari and Orion browsers so I test the site on those.
The site has no tracking, there is no Google Analytics or other JS tracking.</description>

      <description>Hey There. My name is Geordie - that&amp;rsquo;s actually my name, not a nickname or a short form. I&amp;rsquo;m a cloud computing and digital technology consultant in Sydney, Australia. I&amp;rsquo;m a massive fan of basketball and have been a member of the Sydney Kings for over a decade. I love cooking of all sorts, and pretengineering or tinkering and making.
