## Hey There. 
My name is Geordie - that's actually my name, not a nickname or a short form. I'm a cloud computing and digital technology consultant in Sydney, Australia. I'm a massive fan of basketball and have been a member of the Sydney Kings for over a decade. I love cooking of all sorts, and pretengineering or tinkering and making.
