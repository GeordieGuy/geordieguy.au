## Intro

I'm accredited by Basketball NSW as a statistician. It's one of the ways I'm involved with basketball as someone who absolutely, absolutely cannot play basketball. Basketball statisticians are responsible for accurately recording everything that happens in a game of basketball by either commentating the game to the other statisticians verbally using a specific syntax (specificallly saying what's happening as it happens, not screaming "what a shot!") or recording what is commentated in a computer system. The statistics are provided to the coaches during intermissions in low level competitions, and everyone up to and including the news media, betting agencies etc. for the higher ones.

## My experience (I update this page regularly)
