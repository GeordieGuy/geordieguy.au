This site is authored in markdown and compliled to static pages with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The theme is a Split Template by [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/)

I use Visual Sudio Code and Github Desktop to author this on my 2019 Macbook Pro (I still have an eGPU so I'm still on Intel.) I use a mix of Firefox, Safari and Orion browsers so I test the site on those.

The site has no tracking, there is no Google Analytics or other JS tracking. This makes the site load super quick and also respects your privacy. If for some reason you think I should know that you visited my site, tell me.
